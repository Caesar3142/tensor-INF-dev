Tensor-CFD is a project developed by pttensor.com to help accelerate the deployment of OpenFOAM technology in real-world industrial applications. It consists of a collection of templates for specific applications. You simply copy and paste the template, then replace it with your own geometry or boundary conditions! 
Tensor INV is a part of Tensor CFD project, designed for internal flow, incompressible, steady, temperature variation, with RAS turbulent model to simulate mixing chamber, engine manifolds, and any other internal flow cases. 
Please include credit to "tensor-INV" in your work as acknowledgment if you use this template folder.
